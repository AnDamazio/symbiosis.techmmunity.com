# Schemas

Schemas are the things use to describe your database structure.

They are made with `decorators`, and here is a list of all of they:

## Entities Decorators

### `@Entity`

The `@Entity` decorator is used to define a **table** or a sub-entity of your database.

Example of a table:

```ts
@Entity()
class ExampleEntity {}
```

Example of a sub-entity:

```ts
@Entity({ isSubEntity: true })
class ExampleSubEntity {}

@Entity()
class ExampleEntity {
  @Column()
  subEntity: ExampleSubEntity;
}
```

Here are a list of all the configs that you can specify at the decorator options:

#### `name`

The name of the entity in the database.

```ts
@Entity({
  name: "example_name",
})
class ExampleEntity {}

// Or

@Entity("example_name")
class ExampleEntity {}
```

:::caution

This name **isn't affected** by the `namingPattern` of the connection.

:::

#### `isSubEntity`

If the entity is only used as a column value and doesn't have it's own table, you should defined this option as `true`, otherwise a table for this entity will be generated by the migrations.

```ts
@Entity({
  isSubEntity: true,
})
class ExampleEntity {}
```

#### `extras`

Extra data that may be required by plugins.

```ts
@Entity({
  extras: {
    pluginSpecificData: "foo",
  },
})
class ExampleEntity {}
```

## Columns Decorators

### `@PrimaryColumn`
